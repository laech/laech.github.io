# About

Hi, I'm Lae Chen, an independent software engineer based in
Christchurch, New Zealand.

I have been passionate about programming since a young age, and have
been fortunate enough to do it as my job for more than a decade now.
To me it's art, but instead of using paint, I use code, creating
something from a blank canvas is an amazing experience.

Here are some of the things I can do for you:

* **Server side development**. Most of my commercial experience has
  been about designing and building server side systems, APIs, data
  processing, in the cloud or on premise. I find delights in building
  systems that are correct, performant, and well designed. You can
  find my experience in this area in [my CV](/cv.pdf).

* **Open source development**. I love open source, and like to
  contribute when I can to make things better for everyone. I have
  written detailed bug reports to help projects resolve issues
  ([1](https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi/issues/1641),
  [2](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/19366),
  [3](https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/issues/2797)), as well as
  getting hands on and submitting patches
  ([1](https://github.com/k0kubun/xremap/pull/209),
  [2](https://github.com/k0kubun/xremap/pull/217)), I also maintain my
  own set of open source projects, they are mostly for solving my own
  problems, and I share the solutions with others
  ([1](https://github.com/laech/java-stacksrc),
  [2](https://github.com/laech/intellij-actions-tree),
  [3](https://github.com/laech/intellij-jump)).

* **Tools development**. Throughout my career and on my own projects,
  I have built specialized tools for solving specific problems,
  including software frameworks/libraries, command line applications,
  and IDE plugins.

Technologies I use:

* I'll most likely be happy working with your existing tech stack, as
  I'm interested working with different technologies and am able to
  pickup unfamiliar ones quickly. I also believe good engineers will
  produce good work no matter what tech stacks are being used.

* As for what I'm already familiar with, I'm primarily experienced in
  the Java space, but have also worked with other tech stacks to
  varying degrees, including Kotlin, Rust, TypeScript.
