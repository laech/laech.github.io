<h1 class="title">My First Open Source Project</h1>
<div><p>Back in early 2010, when I was fresh out of university, and was still
looking for my first programming job, I started working on my very
first open source project. It was inspired by the last year group
project at the university, I thought I had a few ideas that could take
it further, so I decided to start from scratch.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s more a decade ago at this point, so I have forgotten most of the
things about it, but I still remember spending most of my free time,
day and night, half lying on the couch (not recommended) with my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dell_Studio">Dell
Studio 15</a> laptop at the
time, designing features, class diagrams, writing code, unit tests, UI
tests, reading about good coding practices and applying them on the
project, purely for fun, I loved it, and I had learned so much in the
process.</p>
<p>It was called Rabbit (I couldn&rsquo;t think of better names at the time), a
plugin for <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/ide/">the Eclipse IDE</a>, hosted on
Google Code with SVN, later moved to Git (<a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/rabbit-eclipse/">Google Code archive
here</a>, <a href="https://github.com/laech/eclipse-rabbit">GitHub
archive here</a>), it tracks
statistics on what functionalities you use and how you spent your time
in the IDE. For example, how often you use each command, how much time
you spent editing each file, it even tracks how much time you spent
writing each Java function (I was quite proud of that feature). The
user interface was also pretty awesome, it lets you specify a date
range for the data to view, allows you to aggregate the data in a few
different ways, and draws a bar graph on the side for visualization.</p>
<p>Here are some historical screenshots (all stats shown are actual stats
of me spent working on the project):</p>

<p>And according to the GitHub stats, I&rsquo;ve added ~270K lines and removed
~225K lines of code cross a period of about a year and half between
2010 and 2011, and the project contains roughly ~45K lines of code.</p>
<p>Being an open source project, it has received a few <a href="https://code.google.com/archive/p/rabbit-eclipse/issues">feature requests
and bug
reports</a>. And
I have had some interesting email exchanges with others as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Andr√© from the University of Zurich was expanding on the code as
part of his bachelor thesis.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Russell from Auburn University wanted to use the plugin in one of
his spring classes, and he even extended it to support tracking time
spent on Python classes/functions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone tried to use the plugin as a way to &ldquo;keep people on track&rdquo;,
as they believed their programmers weren&rsquo;t as honest as they would
like them to be&hellip;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now skimming through the project code, it&rsquo;s actually somewhat clean,
well organized, and comes with a lot of unit/integration tests. But of
course, being a young programmer at the time, I have also made quite a
few beginner mistakes, like having useless comments that are pretty
much repeats of the function names, or the lack of proper error
handling, in some places I just catch the error, print it and continue
execution.</p>
<p>Eventually, due to other interests and life commitments, I stopped
working on it, but the things I&rsquo;ve learned from it has stayed me
throughout my career:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of doing things you don&rsquo;t know how to do (yet)</strong>.
I had no idea on how to do any of things when I first started, but
it was the desire and willingness to learn that helped me figure
things out along the way, and that has also helped improve my
research and problem solving skills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Think before you code</strong>. I spent a lot of time thinking about how
to architect the features, I remembered I stopped coding for days
and spent the time thinking how to make the core of the code base
extensible, once I figured it out, I was able to add new features in
very short amount of time. So sometimes you need to slow down so you
can go faster later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Best way to learn is by doing</strong>. If you want to be good at
something you have to practice and practice. You can&rsquo;t learn to ride
a bike by just reading about it.</p>
