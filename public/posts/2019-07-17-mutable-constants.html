<div id="content"><h1>Mutable Constants</h1>
<p>2019-07-17</p>
<p>Mutable constants are essentially constants initialized from mutable
variables.</p>
<p>For example, a constant in code but initialized from an environment
variable, which can be mutated before the constant is initialized to
affect it's value:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">static final Language LANG =
  Language.of(getEnv(&quot;LANG&quot;));
</code></pre>
<p>Another example, this time it isn't a constant but it's intended to be
used like a constant after it's initial value is set by some
annotation processing library:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">@Environment(&quot;LANG&quot;)
private static Language LANG;

static Language lang() {
  return LANG;
}
</code></pre>
<p>There are undesired implications when code is written to use such
constants.</p>
<p>Take the following program that produces different results based on
the current <code>LANG</code> environment variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">static final Language LANG =
  Language.of(getEnv(&quot;LANG&quot;));

static String greet() {
  return LANG.translate(&quot;Hello&quot;);
}

static void main(String... args) {
  println(greet());
}
</code></pre>
<p>It's <strong>untestable</strong> as you can't unit test <code>greet()</code> with different
languages.  One may argue if <code>LANG</code> is made to be non-final, you can
change it's value in unit tests in order to test the <code>greet()</code>. This
basically turns it into a global variable, which is bad on it's own
levels, introduces concurrency problems, and you wouldn't be able to
test <code>greet()</code> with different languages <strong>in parallel</strong>.</p>
<p>It also puts a <strong>hidden dependency</strong> inside <code>greet()</code> that drives it's
behavior, not clear to the caller when looking at it's signature. In
the above example, each time you run the program, <code>greet()</code> may
produce a different result even though it's called with the same
parameters (in this example, empty). It makes <code>greet()</code> a bit magical,
and that's bad, a method's return value should be driven by the input
parameters, not by magic (There maybe exceptions, but this isn't one
of them).</p>
<p>Mutable constants should really be parameters instead:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">static String greet(Language lang) {
  return lang.translate(&quot;Hello&quot;);
}

static void main(String... args) {
  var env = getEnv(&quot;LANG&quot;);
  var lang = Language.of(env);
  println(greet(lang));
}
</code></pre>
<p>This makes the code testable, testable in parallel, dependency is
clear, non-magical.</p>
