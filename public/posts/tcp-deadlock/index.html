<h1 class="title">TCP Deadlock</h1>
<div><p>Let&rsquo;s imagine an echo server implementation, where the server simply
takes the request input stream, copies the bytes to the response
output stream.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s say a client starts sending bytes to the server, and the server
starts writing the bytes out as soon as they come in, it&rsquo;s pretty nice
that the server doesn&rsquo;t need to load the whole request first, which
means the client can see the response quickly if it wishes to.</p>
<p>Except the client is still busy streaming the rest of bytes out to the
server, so it&rsquo;s not ready to read the response yet, even though the
response data has already started to come in.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the server is still writing bytes out, all that has to go
somewhere. First they arrive at the client&rsquo;s TCP receive buffer,
managed by the operating system, once that&rsquo;s full, the client&rsquo;s side
of the TCP connection will tell the server side to stop sending, the
server side TCP listens and stops sending data out the wire, anymore
bytes written by the server will get placed onto the sending TCP
buffer and stay there, once that&rsquo;s full, any attempt to write will
block, and since the server is blocked, it won&rsquo;t read anything from
the input anymore, so that direction of the buffers will get filled up
too, and the client&rsquo;s attempt to write will also block, now we have a
deadlock - the client is waiting for the server to free up the buffer,
the server can&rsquo;t do that because it&rsquo;s waiting for the client to free
up the buffer.</p>
<p>If you were monitoring your TCP Zero Windows you would see something
like this, simplified:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="background-color:#fff;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span style="display:flex;"><span>% tcpdump <span style="color:#d14">&#39;tcp[14:2] = 0&#39;</span>
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>... server &gt; client: ... win <span style="color:#099">0</span> ...
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>... client &gt; server: ... win <span style="color:#099">0</span> ...
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>... server &gt; client: ... win <span style="color:#099">0</span> ...
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>... client &gt; server: ... win <span style="color:#099">0</span> ...
</span></span><span style="display:flex;"><span>... server &gt; client: ... win <span style="color:#099">0</span> ...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Where <code>'win 0'</code> is one side telling the other they have no room for
anymore data.</p>
<p>So it turns out this simple echo server will deadlock given a large
enough request. So to avoid deadlock it will have to consume the whole
request first before sending the response, which will require placing
a restriction on the size of the request. Unless you have full control
of the client code and implement it with reading/writing in parallel.</p>
<p>In fact this problem isn&rsquo;t specific to TCP, any program with similar
IO structure will experience deadlock. For example, a parent process
starts a child process and sends data to it while the child process is
output data at the same time.</p>
