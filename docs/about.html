<div id="content"><h1>About</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Lae Chen, an independent software engineer based in
Christchurch, New Zealand.</p>
<p>I have been passionate about programming since a young age, and have
been fortunate enough to do it as my job for more than a decade now.
To me it's art, but instead of using paint, I use code, creating
something from a blank canvas is an amazing experience.</p>

an email and we can work something out.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I can do for you:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Server side development</strong>. Most of my commercial experience has
been about designing and building server side systems, APIs, data
processing, in the cloud or on premise. I find delights in building
systems that are correct, performant, and well designed. You can
find my experience in this area in <a href="cv.pdf">my CV</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Open source development</strong>. I love open source, and like to
contribute when I can to make things better for everyone. I have
written detailed bug reports to help projects resolve issues
(<a href="https://github.com/springdoc/springdoc-openapi/issues/1641">1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/19366">2</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/mapstruct/mapstruct/issues/2797">3</a>), as well as
getting hands on and submitting patches
(<a href="https://github.com/k0kubun/xremap/pull/209">1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/k0kubun/xremap/pull/217">2</a>), I also maintain my
own set of open source projects, they are mostly for solving my own
problems, and I share the solutions with others
(<a href="https://github.com/laech/java-stacksrc">1</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/laech/intellij-actions-tree">2</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/laech/intellij-jump">3</a>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Tools development</strong>. Throughout my career and on my own projects,
I have built specialized tools for solving specific problems,
including software frameworks/libraries, command line applications,
and IDE plugins.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Technologies I use:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>I'll most likely be happy working with your existing tech stack, as
I'm interested working with different technologies and am able to
pickup unfamiliar ones quickly. I also believe good engineers will
produce good work no matter what tech stacks are being used.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As for what I'm already familiar with, I'm primarily experienced in
the Java space, but have also worked with other tech stacks to
varying degrees, including Kotlin, Rust, TypeScript.</p>
</li>
</ul>
